The idea of having this project as an open source is to enhance it further with some creative and usable functionalities. The README.md file provides a consolidated plan of what all the scope of the project is and what additional functionalities are planned to be deployed in the near future. 

Several ways through which one could contribute to the project are:


**Suggesting additional functionality**

One can suggest - more features to be added to the application by updating the Readme - Future scope map.  Once reviewed and aligned,  the design and implementation can be discussed further. 

**Building for additional features**

You can create a separate branch to implement a new feature or functionality and request for a commit to the owner. Please include relevant test cases and regression testing results before requesting a commit.

**Adding Issues**

While navigating the application, if you come across any issues/challenges you would want to highlight, please add them to the open issue tracker and assign one of the team members. We can further look into the same.
